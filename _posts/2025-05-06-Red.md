This is just a quick blog post so that I can show and see what this will look like when I do a full one. Red is about something else 
entirely. I really want some Korean food. It's so unfair how I'm literally always craving that food. I should totally make some 
dumplings tomorrow. I really want to try to make a veggie dumpling bc hello? I've never made that before and that sounds great.
What other food am I thinking about? Mmmh the Korean cold noodles that make you feel scafred if they aren't cut before you eat them. 
I really need to pray and spend time really sitting cause bro, it's not funny anymore. I really don't want to get into trouble 
but same sentence I'm kind of tired too. Man Idk gang. Psalm 45 type stuff.
